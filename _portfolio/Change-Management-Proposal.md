This is a 2000 word change management proposal for an online discord community server for the fictional podcast "Arrested Politics". The proposal begins with initial identification of the key stakeholders, strategic challenges, and areas of tension for the propsed change of arriving upon a set of codified server rules. The report recognises sub-cultre differences and proposes a Change Plan using Lewin's three step model: Field Theory, Group Dynamics, Action Research, and the Unfreeze-Moving-Refreeze model are used. A conclusion offers key considerations and potential limitations for the plan.
