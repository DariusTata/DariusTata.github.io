I completed my final year undergraduate research project at the University of Sussex in 2024, investigating how leaders working in or with technology choose the right leadership style. Academic literature uses a Person-Situation distinction as an orienting  assumption. While my project didn't address this inadequate Person-Situation dichotomy directly, I tried to investigate *how* my participants engage with changing their leading and managing approach.
