## Original Project
I completed my final year undergraduate research project at the University of Sussex investigating how leaders working in or with technology choose the right leadership style. Academic literature uses a Person-Situation distinction as an orienting  assumption: studies either focus the on situational factors or an individual's factors. The literature broadly draws out that certain styles are more appropriate for certain situations, and different persons are more easily suited to particular styles. Can styles be taught? The academic concensus is: Yes. The cleft in research opinion is whether styles can be taught as the need arises in time-sensitive scenarios, or whether styles need to be taught in advance and in a time-senstitve sceranio a more suited leader should be chosen. While my project didn't address this inadequate Person-Situation dichotomy directly, I tried to investigate *how* technical leaders engage with changing their leading and managing approach.

## Secondary Analysis
I performed secondaray analysis of my original research using Natural Language Processing methods in Python while studying at The London Interdisciplinay School as a postgraduate student. I successfully verified the number of Themes I identified during primary analysis by using KMeans Topic Modelling clustering and improvement ratio analysis.
